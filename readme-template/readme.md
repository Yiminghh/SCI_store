Official Implementations of ISMnet(*Information Processing & Management 2024)*.

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=Yiminghh/HiGCN)

Detected an inconsistency between mining influential nodes and simplices. Innovatively formulated the influential simplices mining task as a graph learning problem and designed an influential simplices mining neural network (ISMnet) that achieves SOTA performance in this task.

# Installation
This code is developed with Python3, and we recommend python>=3.8 and PyTorch ==1.13.0. Install the dependencies with Anaconda and activate the environment with:

    conda create --name GOUB python=3.8
    conda activate GOUB
    pip install -r requirements.txt



# Important Option Details
* `dataroot_GT`: Ground Truth (High-Quality) data path.
* `dataroot_LQ`: Low-Quality data path.
* `pretrain_model_G`: Pretraind model path.
* `GT_size, LQ_size`: Size of the data cropped during training.
* `niter`: Total training iterations.
* `val_freq`: Frequency of validation during training.
* `save_checkpoint_freq`: Frequency of saving checkpoint during training.
* `gpu_ids`: In multi-GPU training, GPU ids are separated by commas in multi-gpu training.
* `batch_size`: In multi-GPU training, must satisfy relation: *batch_size/num_gpu>1*.
